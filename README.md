# Sentiment Analysis

### Introduction

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. It is widely used to analyze customer feedback, social media posts, reviews, and more to gauge public opinion.

### Key Concepts

### Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing text data for analysis. Common steps include:
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all text to lowercase.
- **Removing Punctuation and Stopwords**: Filtering out non-essential words and punctuation.
- **Lemmatization/Stemming**: Reducing words to their base or root form.

### Tokenization Example

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
text = "I love this product! It's amazing."
tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
print(tokens)
```

### Removing Stopwords Example

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
tokens = ["i", "love", "this", "product", "it's", "amazing"]
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]
print(filtered_tokens)
```

### Feature Extraction

Converting text into numerical representations that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Common techniques include:
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Representing text as a set of word frequencies.
- **TF-IDF**: Weighing words by their importance in the document and corpus.

#### TF-IDF Example

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
corpus = ["I love this product.", "I hate this product.", "This product is okay."]
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(X.toarray())
```

### Model Training

Train a machine learning model on preprocessed and vectorized text data. Popular algorithms include:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks

### Naive Bayes Example

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Example corpus and labels
corpus = ["I love this product.", "I hate this product.", "This product is okay."]
labels = ['positive', 'negative', 'neutral']

# TF-IDF Vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# Training Naive Bayes model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

## Applications

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understanding customer opinions and sentiments from reviews and feedback.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Analyzing public sentiment on social media platforms.
- **Market Research**: Gauging consumer sentiment towards products or services.
- **Brand Monitoring**: Tracking brand reputation and public perception.

## Conclusion

Sentiment analysis using NLP and machine learning is a powerful tool for extracting insights from textual data. By leveraging these techniques, it is possible to build effective models that can accurately classify sentiments, providing valuable information for various applications.
